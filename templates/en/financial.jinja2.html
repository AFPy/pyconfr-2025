    <h2>Financial Assistance – Closed</h2>
    <p>
      We sincerely thank you for your interest in this edition's financial assistance program.
      Please note that the financial assistance program is now closed, as our budget for this year has been fully allocated. Unfortunately, no new applications can be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We thank everyone who submitted an application, and we hope to be able to offer this support again in the next edition.
      If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:tresorier@afpy.org">tresorier@afpy.org</a>

    <h2>Financial Assistance</h2>
    <p>
      AFPy offers financial assistance for students or persons whose resources
      do not allow them to come to PyConFR. To apply, write an e-mail to the AFPy
      treasurer (<a href="mailto:tresorier@afpy.org">tresorier@afpy.org</a>)
      explaining briefly:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        your current status (student, looking for a job…);
      </li>
      <li>
        the reason for your participation (attending conferences, sprints,
        presentation of a project…);
      </li>
      <li>
        a rough estimate of the cost of your journey to PyConFR (travel and
        accommodation);
      </li>
      <li>
        any other information you deem necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must not exceed 400 words in your application. If you are accepted,
      you will receive a maximum of €200 if you come from Europe, or €400 if
      you come from outside Europe, corresponding to a maximum refund of 75% of
      your transport and accommodation costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The money will be delivered by SEPA transfer or by PayPal, after the event, as soon as the
      supporting documents (invoices, train tickets…) are sent. Other means of
      payment are not admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Applications must be sent
      to <a href="mailto:tresorier@afpy.org">tresorier@afpy.org</a> before September
      30<sup>th</sup>. After this date, for the sake of equality, applications
      will be refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will receive a reply at least one month before the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Requests are processed on a first-come, first-served basis. We therefore
      advice you to send your request as early as possible.
